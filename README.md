# Materials Science Workshop on Machine Learning

This repository contains a jupyter notebook for a workshop on machine learning for materials science.

This notebook is based on the data and methodology from the paper “A feasibility study of machine learning-assisted alloy design using wrought aluminum alloys as an example” by Soofi et al, Computational Materials Science 215 (2022) 111783.
This paper and the accompanying data can be found at <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2022.111783>.
